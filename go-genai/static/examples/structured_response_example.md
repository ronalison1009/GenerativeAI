# Structured Response Example

This is an example of a **structured response** using markdown formatting. Structured responses are easier to read and understand.

## Key Features

- **Headers** for organizing content
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Go code example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Lists

Here's an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And an unordered list:

- Apples
- Bananas
- Oranges

## Links

You can include [links to documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

## Benefits of Structured Responses

- Easier to scan and read
- Better organization of information
- Clearer hierarchy of content
- More professional appearance
