# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production
- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated containers
- **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is installed
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to virtual machines

## Basic Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands:

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull ubuntu

# List all images
docker images

# Run a container
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# List running containers
docker ps
```

## Docker Components

1. **Docker Engine**: The core of Docker
2. **Docker Images**: Templates for containers
3. **Docker Containers**: Running instances of images
4. **Docker Registry**: Storage for Docker images
